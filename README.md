## FAQ

#### What if we enter a wrong Equation?

The system will throw error if wrong expression is provided.

#### Does this work with Brakets

Yes it does. It has a functionality to render operator before and after the brakets if not provided.
It also check the number of open and close brackets before calculation and throwan error if found something.

#### What we use for calculation inside project code
We use `eval()` javascript functionality to do the calculation. And for reducing the errors we use Loops and conditions.
